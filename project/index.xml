      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to facilitate better clinical workflow and provide added assurance during motion-managed proton therapy delivery, I am developing a clinical computer vision application (Code name: Wukong), based on high-speed acquisition and real-time processing of fluoroscopic frames. Built as a fully DICOM-aware utility, this .NET/C# Windows desktop application is integrated into existing treatment planning infrastructure, both for treatment plan information communication and permanent data archival on a HIPAA-compliant cloud storage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flat-panel Detector Calibration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Accurate delivery of radiotherapy dose is predicated upon careful motion management. This is particularly true for spot-scanned proton therapy. Our proton therapy vendor developed a stereoscopic kV X-ray image-guidance platform for this purpose. While it is engineered to a given specification, the actual positions of the components (e.g. flat-panel detectors) may contain small errors. This project delivers an iterative algorithmic calibration routine to correct such errors, i.e. translation, rotation and non-affine distortions. The main motivation behind this routine is to enable high-fidelity perspective overlays of RT structure sets in our in-house clinical software. It may also be used as an independent QA of vendor&amp;rsquo;s own calibrations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nanoconfined polymer electrolytes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We probe the nanoscale viscosity and molecular structure of confined polymer electrolytes inside rigid nanovolumes, using X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) and grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), respectively. We show that gold nanoparticle as Brownian swimmers can be used to probe the nanoscale viscosity of a confined polymer melt, and that the effective viscosity is substantially different than in bulk. Our experiments take advantage of recent instrumental improvements at the Coheren Hard X-ray Scattering Beamline (CHX) at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II), which have yielded improved coherence, and extended beam stability.&lt;/p&gt;
