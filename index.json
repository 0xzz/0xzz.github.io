It is also the cornerstone of several advanced 3D-enabled biomedical applications, such as ParaView and 3D Slicer.\nPerhaps lesser known, VTK provides a built-in high performance DICOM parser, because of its deep roots within the biomedical community. For my own clinical project, I have recently started learning and using VTK. I found its learning curve to be somewhat steep for a beginner, mostly due to the scarcity of up-to-date tutorials. These are my notes on compiling VTK 8.2.0 from source under Windows 10 after trial-and-error and copious amount of googling, for future reference; I hope they can help you save some time, if you happen to be in the same shoes.\nHow to obtain VTK? VTK is written in C++. The easiest approach that I found to obtain pre-compiled binaries is through PyPI. VTK wheels for all major platforms are available. On Windows, pip downloads pre-compiled DLLs into the \u0026ldquo;site-packages\\vtk\u0026rdquo; directory of your Python distribution.\n\u0026gt; pip install vtk  You can call methods within these DLLs through the Python bindings.\nimport vtk  The Python bindings expose the VTK function signatures, but there are no equivalent C/C++ header files in this PIP-installed VTK directory. To build against VTK using C++, it\u0026rsquo;s better to compile directly from source code, which is available at vtk.org under BSD license.\nWhere to find the most up-to-date compiling/building guide? VTK is under active development by Kitware, Inc. This means that if you google \u0026ldquo;compile vtk\u0026rdquo; like I did, you will likely end up with obsolete tutorials. In fact, by the time you saw this blog post, it has probably become outdated in many ways.\nI found that the best guide for building the latest release is directly hosted on VTK\u0026rsquo;s development GitLab repository: build_windows_vs.md. I assume this document gets the maintainers\u0026rsquo; first attention whenever something is changed between releases.\nIn addition, the VTK Wiki contains lots of useful information. There is also the VTK Mailing List if you\u0026rsquo;d like to reach out to the VTK community directly.\nPrerequisites  Chocolatey to help manage packages.\n CMake\n\u0026gt; choco install cmake   Download and install Visual Studio. This is for the Microsoft Visual C++ compilers, so be sure to select them during installation.\n VTK source code\n  Generate Visual Studio project using CMake I put all of my dev tools under the same directory (C:\\toolchain). Extract VTK code source to \u0026ldquo;C:/toolchain/VTK/VTK-8.2.0-src\u0026rdquo;. Set the \u0026ldquo;Where to build the binaries\u0026rdquo; blank to \u0026ldquo;C:/toolchain/VTK/VTK-8.2.0-bld\u0026rdquo;. It is preferable to put the build directory outside the source directory.\nClick \u0026ldquo;Configure\u0026rdquo; to have CMake sort out the compilation variables. CMake will first prompt you to choose the generator.\nCompilation variables  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: This is rather important, as it sets the installation path of your compiled binaries. I changed the default path to a non-privileged location (C:/toolchain/VTK/VTK-8.2.0) so as to avoid dealing with permissions. While it is okay not to \u0026ldquo;install\u0026rdquo; VTK after building it - you can simply reference the build directory - the installation process extracts the \u0026ldquo;essence\u0026rdquo; of the built VTK files (.h, .lib, .dll, etc.) into an independent directory, and modifies the system environment variables for your convenience.\n BUILD_SHARED_LIBS: Check to build DLLs. Otherwise, only static libraries (.lib) will be generated.\n CMAKE_CXX_MP_FLAG: Check to support multi-core processors.\n BUILD_TESTING: Check to build testing cases.\n BUILD_EXAMPLES: Check to build examples.\n BUILD_DOCUMENTATION: Check to build documentation.\n If you are building VTK for use with Java, Python, MFC or Qt, you will need to check relevant compilation variables. I do not need those, so I skipped them.\n  BUILD_DOCUMENTATION is not really necessary, because it\u0026rsquo;s available for download (vtkDocHtml). It takes a long time to build the documentation and needs extra dev packages to support the compilation. I was mainly curious to see if there are any differences between my build vs the downloaded one.\nSeveral tutorials that I read recommend unchecking BUILD_TESTING, BUILD_EXAMPLES to save compilation time, because these examples tend to take even more time to compile than the core part of the VTK library. I figured that sample codes can be tremendously helpful for a beginner, so I decided to build them anyway.\nFor building these extra parts, you will need additional packages:\n For building documentation\n Doxygen\n Perl\n  \u0026gt; choco install strawberryperl   Graphviz. This package contains the dot executable required by Doxygen.  \u0026gt; choco install graphviz   For building testing\n VTKData and VTKLargeData. These are data and baseline images for VTK regression testing and other VTK examples. In principle, these two data sets should have been put together. They are separated into two batches because of long cvs checkout times. If you wish to test on VTKLargeData, you will need to check the VTK_USE_LARGE_DATA variable in CMake.\n  VTKData Older tutorials instructed me to set the VTK_DATA_ROOT for building examples. This variable is nowhere to be found in the current release. As it turns out, the VTK maintainers made some changes to the structure of the test data. You will now only need to extract the \u0026ldquo;.ExternalData\u0026rdquo; folder directly into the source directory (C:/toolchain/VTK/VTK-8.2.0-src/.ExternalData) and CMake will automatically download everything.\n On Tuesday, September 12, 2017 9:32 AM, David E DeMarle wrote:\nWe changed the structure of regression test data in 6.1 to allow developers to make proposed changes to code and data concurrently and ensure that the continuous integration test machines do not fail when they run new tests on old data. The net result is that a VTK build tree has test data files that are actually symbolic links to the md5 files which live elsewhere. You can generally open and use the symbolic links exactly as you would a normal data file. If you turn on testing in your build, cmake will try to download each one of the files. Alternatively you can untar the source and data packages for a release in the same directory and the default build setup will use them and avoid downloading anything else.\n Compiling Click \u0026ldquo;Configure\u0026rdquo; every time you change any variables. It may take a few times. Correct all errors and make sure there are no reds, as seen below: Then click \u0026ldquo;Generate\u0026rdquo; to create the Visual Studio solution file, and then click \u0026ldquo;Open Project\u0026rdquo;. This will launch Visual Studio. Set the Build Configuration to \u0026ldquo;RelWithDebInfo\u0026rdquo;. Build (\u0026ldquo;Build \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Build Solution\u0026rdquo;) the ALL_BUILD project first, which is the default when Visual Studio is launched. This may take a while. The compiled DLLs will be located in \u0026ldquo;C:\\toolchain\\VTK\\VTK-8.2.0-bld\\bin\\RelWithDebInfo\\\u0026ldquo;.\nBuild the INSTALL project.

This paper presents a new method, based on gel–liquid infiltration polymerization, to form hybrid skin layers atop elastomers. The method is unique in that it allows for control of the skin layer topography, with tunable feature sizes and aspect ratios as high as 1.8 without fracture. Unlike previous techniques, the skin layer formed here dramatically improves the barrier properties of the elastomer, while preserving skin layer flexibility. Moreover, the method is versatile and likely applicable to most interfacial polymerization systems and network polymers on flat and patterned surfaces.","tags":null,"title":"Formation of a Crack-Free, Hybrid Skin Layer with Tunable Surface Topography and Improved Gas Permeation Selectivity on Elastomers Using Gel–Liquid Infiltration Polymerization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiliang Liu","Julien Lhermitte","Ye Tian","Zheng Zhang","Dantong Yu","Kevin G.

We present a method to heal X-ray scattering images, filling gaps in the data and removing defects in a physically meaningful manner.

In particular, we exploit statistical tests and symmetry analysis to identify the structure of an image; we then copy, average and interpolate measured data into gaps in a way that respects the identified structure and symmetry. Importantly, the underlying analysis methods provide useful characterization of structures present in the image, including the identification of diffuse versus sharp features, anisotropy and symmetry. The presented method leverages known characteristics of reciprocal space, enabling physically reasonable reconstruction even with large image gaps. The method will correspondingly fail for images that violate these underlying assumptions. The method assumes point symmetry and is thus applicable to small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data, but only to a subset of wide-angle data.

Here, we report that the preferential wetting of PMMA within a PS/PMMA thin film can be prevented under normal pressure. Moreover, the external pressure drives the PMMA wetting layer at the substrate (or a PMMA cushion layer intentionally placed between the blend film and the superstrate) into the isolated PMMA domains within the blend film. This results in a film morphology normally observed on neutral surfaces, revealing that normal pressure can potentially be used to effectively control the blend film morphology by preventing the hydrodynamic wetting.","tags":[""],"title":"External normal pressure prevents preferential wetting of PS/PMMA blend thin films","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lewis M.

Although most precursor/solvent systems result in uniform dense films after the process, reaction-induced phase separation can occur in solvents with a unique combination of solubility, evaporation rate and ratio of latent heat to heat capacity. Most significantly, for such solvents, the forced convective evaporation under controlled N2 flow results in a highly hierarchical film morphology, featuring a skin layer on top of a layer of microspheres formed via a nucleation and growth mechanism. For the first time, the skin layer formed during the evaporation was directly observed after the complete evaporation of the solvent. The thickness of the skin layer is dependent on the processing parameters including the N2 flow rate, UV intensity and precursor concentrations. The skin layer formation could be suppressed by addition of non-solvent, in which case the characteristic morphology resulted from dominant spinodal decomposition. A model is presented that can qualitatively describe the skin layer formation and its dependence on the processing parameters, providing a mechanistic understanding of the photocrosslinking-induced phase separation under evaporative environments.","tags":null,"title":"Photocrosslinking-induced phase separation in evaporative solvents: formation of skin layers and microspheres","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zheng Zhang","Liang Wang","Yifu Ding"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1360281600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1360281600,"objectID":"7aac4883d3f59300fb4c593938bbfa50","permalink":"https://zhangresearch.org/publication/influence-of-substrate-confinement/","publishdate":"2013-02-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/influence-of-substrate-confinement/","section":"publication","summary":"We investigated the influence of substrate confinement on the capillary breakup of parallel nonaxisymmetric polymer stripes suspended on top of, or confined between, another immiscible polymer pattern.

It is found that TiC is a good catalyst for the reversible hydriding/dehydriding process of NaAlH4 at moderate temperatures by reducing the decomposition temperature and improving the hydriding/dehydriding kinetics. The hydrogen desorption capacity of 5 mol% TiC-doped NaAlH4 is 4.6 wt% at 165 °C and its average dehydriding rate in the first 30 min reaches 0.107 wt%/min. X-ray diffraction analyses show that the size of crystal grains of the composites is reduced by ball-milling, and is then increased rapidly in the first hydriding–dehydriding cycle. Scanning electron micrographs represent that the particle size of the ball-milled composites is quite even and averages around 50 nm. However, it changes into a widely distributed one ranging from 50 nm to 1 μm in the subsequent hydriding–dehydriding cycles. DSC measurement indicates that the doping of TiC can lower the dehydriding temperatures of sodium aluminum hydride.","tags":null,"title":"Reversible hydrogen storage behaviors and microstructure of TiC-doped sodium aluminum hydride","type":"publication"}]
